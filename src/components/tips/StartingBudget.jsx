                    You got your entrance set up, now you want to build. Cims will ask for some basics like power, water, sewage, garbage, coroner services, and they cost money. Keep reading to find out how to fine tune your expenses so you don't bankrupt your city.

                    First thing your cims will ask is water(plus sewage disposal) and power. So you go to power menu and want to start with a Windmill. It's cheap and just enough for your starting city. I hate to disappoint you, but this is the wrong choice. Same as choosing a water tower instead of a water pump.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    The reason is simple: windmills may be more than enough for the starting city and are cheap, but when the need for power of your city increases, they become a costly option. If you choose a coal power plant, it's going to cost way more, but you can cut down on its budget and raise it as necessary. Windmills will satisfy the need for your starting city, but buying another one costs way more than just increasing the budget for a coal power plant. Eventually, you will have to buy another coal power plant to continue this cycle, but by then, you will already have an established budget.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    Your cims will ask other things that will require a lot of money to build, like fire departments, garbage and coroners services, and you will save a lot of time, money and will have to worry less if you already built a coal power plant. Hence, windmills are mostly a solution for already established cities that want to get rid of pollution, or for aesthetic reasons. Even if your idea is to build a clean and eco city, you will have to tough this one out before your budget stabilizes.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    Now that you set up your power and water to be efficient, don't forget to increase the budget as demand rises!
                </p>

                <p className="text-justify">
                    Speaking of budget, there are number of things that need to be fine adjusted to assure you don't go bankrupt before you can play the game freely. One of them is the taxes. Cims will tolerate the taxes up to 12% so if you want to have the best money income, you can raise the taxes up to 12%. You can go above, but cims will then start leaving your city. Also, some high level businesses and industries will not operate even with 12% taxes. I encountered one hotel that won't work with taxes greater than 11%. They will let you know.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    After adjusting the taxes, and giving cims services what they  absolutely need (fire department, garbage collection, cemetery), you need to adjust their budget as well. By the way, don't build anything until they ask for it. It can save you from wasting money on clinics if cims are not sick, saving you substantial amount of money. This is especially important in this stage of the game. Follow your inspector tool and check the coverage and availability. 
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    Depending on your city size, cut fire department, health services (cemetery falls into this category too), police (if you have it) to 60% and garbage to 75%. You will need to increase the garbage services budget as your city grows, before you make another landfill. Build a Waste incinerator plant as soon as you can, and start emptying the landfills. This is because landfills have limited capacity and are very difficult to remove in game, unless you use a hack (hint: natural disasters ;)
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    As for cemeteries, they have limited capacity too and you can replace them with crematoriums, but this is not necessary. If you want to keep the cemeteries for any reason, even if they are full, nobody is stopping you. However, have in mind that they will take away from your total number of hearses, lowering the capacity. These hearses will be counted towards total number, but the ones from full cemeteries won't be operating. And if you need to empty the cemetery, this will also lower your hearse availability, as they need to transfer the corpses to crematoriums or even other cemeteries. Having crematoriums is recommended, but not mandatory.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    As a final budget tip, this one works if you already have an established city, but your income is not enough and you need the money. Raise your taxes as much as you can, and leave it for some time. This will displease your cims and they will start leaving the city. Pay close attention to your citizen count and return the taxes as they were earlier, before they start leaving. This is very risky and requires paying close attention, but it's better than taking a loan, imho.

                <p className="text-justify">
                    It took me a couple of ruined cities in the old SimCity 4 to recognize that loans are a bad idea. Sure, they give you money when you need it, but hang like a heavy weight on your profit, keeping you away from establishing a healthy budget.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    Let me explain: without a loan, if you plan carefully, you can get fairly quickly to a healthy positive profit, unless you play on hard mode in which case you don't need this guide. With the loan, even if you get a healthy profit, you won't notice it because the monthly payment for the loan will make you think you're still losing money. This can result in frustrations and sinking your city in more debt, especially with players that are not good with budgeting and don't have the patience to build the city slowly.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    I won't, nor I can, stop you from taking one, but I would highly discourage it. Even if you take one, take the smallest one so the monthly charge won't weigh you down significantly.

                    Traffic! I know you want to read more about it. When you start your city, it's important to plan ahead. Start with smallest, hence cheapest, streets and upgrade them later. Trust me, it's fairly easy and fast to get enough money to build what you want in Cities: Skylines, so just be patient.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    Think about the collector roads, main avenues and leave enough space for future upgrades. One suggestion I can offer is to keep zoning areas at least 2 squares apart. What I mean by this is when building roads, you will have this zoning grid which  extends 4 squares from the road you're building. If you have 2 parallel roads, leave empty space equal to 2 squares of zoning between them(4sq. + 2sq. + 4 sq.). This is the space required if you want to upgrade a 2 lane road to a 4 lane road: each of the parallel roads takes 1 square for an upgrade. Leaving 2 squares of space gives you the ability to maximally use the space between the roads and maybe even put a lane of trees or a pedestrian/bike path between them.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    I would also recommend using "T" intersections instead of "X"("+") ones, as it is easier to organize the traffic. Later, when you have enough money, you can make your own custom intersections. If you have agriculture and lvl 1-2 industry, they will be ok with dirt roads, but if you have a collector road in the industrial area, it would be good to make it 2 or even 4 way industrial road. Residential and commercial will also be ok with dirt roads, but it would be good to upgrade them as soon as possible or when the traffic becomes a problem.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                    At this stage, you still probably don't have enough money to build what you want, but that doesn't mean you can't plan ahead. Leave space for some bigger buildings that unlock later such as parks, libraries, highschools, train stations, bus terminals, landmarks and other buildings with large footprints.

                <p className="text-justify">
                    Road maintenance is not an area you should tamper with, because it can cause you to have issues with traffic. Bad road maintenance can make your roads be less maintained, which means lower speeds and traffic jams. That is why you should leave the road maintenance budget as is, all the time.

                    Utilities and services are a category where you can fine tune the budget, but another place where you can reduce the budget costs is reducing the number of vehicles for public transport through the budget.

                    Of course, this will only work if you have any public transport lines established in your city. Ports, train stations and airports also fall under this category.
