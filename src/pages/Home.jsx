            This page was made to give you bits of information about some basic and advanced techniques and mechanics for the game Cities: Skylines. As Cities: Skylines 2 is soon to be released, some of the techniques can be applied to it too, but the whole website was designed in mind for the Skylines 1. The idea is to give you short tutorials for the topics I saw recurring mostly on the internet.
